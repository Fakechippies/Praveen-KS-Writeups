The show was created by Rob McElhenney, who developed it with Glenn Howerton. It is executive produced and primarily written by McElhenney, Howerton, and Charlie Day, starring alongside Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito. The series follows the exploits of "The Gang", a group of narcissistic, sociopathic friends who run the Irish bar Paddy's Pub in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but spend most of their free time drinking, scheming, arguing amongst themselves, and plotting elaborate cons against others (and at times each other), often for petty reasons such as personal benefit, financial gain, revenge, or simply out of boredom, while belittling, berating, and manipulating each other in the process at seemingly any opportunity.<br />
