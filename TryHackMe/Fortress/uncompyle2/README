Introduction
------------

'uncompyle2' converts Python byte-code back into equivalent Python
source. It accepts byte-code from Python version 2.7 only. Additionally,
it will only run on Python 2.7.

The generated source is very readable: docstrings, lists, tuples and
hashes get pretty-printed.

'uncompyle2' may also verify the equivalence of the generated source by
by compiling it and comparing both byte-codes.

'uncompyle2' is based on John Aycock's generic small languages compiler
'spark' (http://www.csr.uvic.ca/~aycock/python/) and his prior work on
a tool called 'decompyle'. This tool has been vastly improved by
Hartmut Goebel `http://www.crazy-compilers.com/`_

Additional note (3 July 2004, Ben Burton):

    This software is no longer available from the original website. It
    has now become a commercial decompilation service, with no
    software available for download.

    Any developers seeking to make alterations or enhancements to this code
    should therefore consider these debian packages an appropriate starting
    point.

Features
--------

  * decompiles Python byte-code into equivalent Python source

  * decompiles byte-code from Python version 2.7

  * pretty-prints docstrings, hashes, lists and tuples
  
  * reads directly from .pyc/.pyo files, bulk-decompile whole
    directories

  * output may be written to file, a directory or to stdout

  * option for including byte-code disassembly into generated source

  For a list of changes please refer to the 'CHANGES' file.


Requirements
------------

uncompyle2 requires Python 2.7


Installation
------------

You may either create a RPM and install this, or install directly from
the source distribution.

Creating RPMS:

  python setup.py bdist_rpm

  If you need to force the python interpreter to eg. python2:
     python2 setup.py bdist_rpm --python=python2


Installation from the source distribution:

     python setup.py install

   To install to a user's home-dir:
     python setup.py install --home=<dir>

   To install to another prefix (eg. /usr/local)
     python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local

  If you need to force the python interpreter to eg. python2:
     python2 setup.py install

Usage
-----

uncompyle2 -h		prints short usage
uncompyle2 --help	prints long usage
